## About

This project is based on the Traversy Media tutorial on Tailwind CSS with React: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiGmAI5e91M&t=995s 

This site lets you search for stock images, similar to Pixabay or Unsplash.

It utilizes the Pixabay API to find photos.

I really enjoyed learning Tailwind, and I am excited to use it in future projects! I made some minor changes, including adding a title and making the design mobile-responsive.
